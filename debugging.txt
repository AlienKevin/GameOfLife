We encountered a bug when trying to implement the GUI part of the simulation. Because there's no emptyCell function and we have to clear the whole board before every generation, we initially couldn't correctly fill the circles. At first, no circles appeared after LifeGUI::clear(). We reread the spec and found that we should use LifeGUI::resize(r, c) instead. After that, circles reappeared after clearning the board but dead cells from previous generations were not properly cleaned. We identified the functions that modified the board and inserted some cout statements to see when were the dead cells been added to the board. We finally found that we didn't test if the cell was occupied or not before adding one to the board when its number of neighbors equals two. So we added an if statement using isCellOccupied function and solved the whole problem.
