# This is a Chinese word (pronounced "ming") which means "life". Throughout the simulation, this character
# undergoes near disappearance and resurgence and ended up disappearing after 104 steps. We think that the
# fluctuation of the simulation symbolizes the ups and downs in life and the fact that the cells never form back
# into the original character symbolizes that there's no way to turn back in life and everyone is always changing # and evolving.
